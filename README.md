##  What I Learned
*(This is the most critical section for your LoR eligibility. Fill in these specific technical details)*

1.  **Translating AI Design to Code:** Successfully defined and implemented the **BlackBerry concept's custom color palette** (Charcoal/Cyan) into the Tailwind CSS configuration, translating abstract AI visuals into a functional, consistent design system.
2.  **Next.js & Strapi Decoupling:** Mastered the workflow of setting up a **Strapi content model** and securely querying the data via API routes in a **Next.js frontend**. I specifically utilized Next.js's data fetching (`getStaticProps`/`getServerSideProps`) to optimize page loading while retrieving fresh content from the CMS.
3.  **Enterprise-Level SEO/UX:** Focused on using Next.js's built-in **Image Optimization** and proper **SEO metadata** to ensure the rebrand was not just aesthetically pleasing but also technically performant and findableâ€”essential for an enterprise target audience.
